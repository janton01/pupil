Issue:
Not Understanding why I can run my code and not Andre's to get results.

Step 1: understand how the different parameters I have placed in my code affect the results:

1)Size  of hmd_frame size changed
1000*7.5/9, 1000 to 1000,1000
.
Getting worse results... Will try again
When moving slower with my eyes the results seem identical and very accurate. IT looked unaccurate before probably because code went directly from calibration to running the test.
Added a sleep.
You can see the square
-
Changed to hmd_frame size of 1000*9/7.5
Screen size does not seem to be that important factor
it might improve the quality of results, but would need to think of metrics to determine this
.
.
2) test 3d vs. 2d mapping
2d actually seemed better in terms of filtering out the noise...
.
.
his calibration + my code to graph works. It improves the results when comparing it to uncalibrated as it performs better mapping.
